This is a JavaScript application I am developing as part of a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/1001dMAEcYd11RRw==/ "The Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy"). You can add any incoming and outgoing expenses to track your spending.
Note: HTML + CSS is provided by course leader, JavaScript written is by myself.
